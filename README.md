# Quality-Inspection
This is a project developed to conduct quality inspection of Dengue Kits using custom object detection to ensure the design of the kit is correct.

>ðŸ’¡ **This was developed by training a custom object detection model using Yolov4.**

## Main aspects of the project
1. Designing of the multiple components using Fusion 360. 
2. Assembling of all the components to showcase the entire system.
3. Training the model using Yolov4 to carry out custom object detection
4. Creating a streamlit webapp to show the output on the screen.
5. Rendering all this into one main video to show how the entire project would look on an industrial level.

## Training result 
Attached below is the result of the dengue kit
